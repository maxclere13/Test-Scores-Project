# Test-Scores-Project

Create a program That has .cpp and .h files to calculate grades as well as descriptive statistics for a set of test scores.The test scores can be entered via a user prompt or through an external file.  For each student, you need to provide a student name (string) and a test score (float).    
 
 The program will do the followings:  
 • Assign a grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on a student’s test score.   
 • Display the grade roster as shown below:

 • Calculate the following descriptive statistics (as shown below)

 The program must use:
     o A loop structure (for-loop, while-loop, or do-while-loop) 
     o Conditional processing (if-then-else) 
     o Arrays or vectors
